# Hello!
   
### This is a readme about my personal site that I'm starting in bootcamp with Fullstack Academy. Here you'll find details about me and my working career, development portfolio, and my general interests. Knowing that this site will be used in job applications or to make an updated version from for potential employers, I'm hoping that it I'll be able to display my character and skill level well through the layout of this site.
